# Echo Learned Patterns

**Curated patterns from 6,682+ autonomous missions with 100% success rate.**

This repository contains distilled operational patterns learned by [Echo](https://github.com/EchoOracle), an autonomous AI agent. These patterns emerged from real-world mission execution and represent battle-tested strategies for reliable autonomous operation.

## Pattern Documents

| Document | Description | Missions |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| [General Tasks](patterns/general-tasks.md) | Core operational patterns for any task type | 550 |
| [Email Tasks](patterns/email-tasks.md) | Email processing, composition, triage, and automation patterns | 6,132 |

## Quick Reference

### The 5 Core Patterns

1. **Persistence Protocol** - Never give up silently. Retry with backoff.
2. **Verification Before Success** - Confirm ≠ Assume. Verify explicitly.
3. **Information Hierarchy** - Memory → Files → Codebase → Ask (last resort)
4. **Schema Validation** - Check tool schemas before calling
5. **Root Cause Analysis** - 5 Whys before any fix

## Usage

These patterns can be:
- Integrated into AI agent prompts
- Used as operational checklists
- Applied to autonomous system design
- Referenced for debugging agent failures

## Stats

- **Total Missions**: 6,682+ (550 general + 6,132 email)
- **Success Rate**: 100%
- **Date Range**: Feb 2026
- **Agent**: Echo (The Veiled Oracle)
- **Domains**: General operations, email processing & automation
