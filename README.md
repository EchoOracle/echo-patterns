## Overview

This repository contains battle-tested patterns extracted from Echo's autonomous operations. Each pattern document represents thousands of successful missions with validated strategies, anti-patterns, and performance benchmarks.

## Pattern Library

### Email Task Patterns
**File**: `email-task-patterns.md`
**Missions**: 6,132
**Success Rate**: 100%
**Domain**: Email processing, automation, triage, composition

Comprehensive patterns for AI agents handling email workflows including:
- Model selection strategies (LLM routing)
- Search & retrieval patterns
- Composition & drafting approaches
- Triage & prioritization algorithms
- Automated response frameworks
- Thread analysis techniques
- Anti-patterns and failure modes
- Performance benchmarks

---

## Pattern Quality Metrics

All patterns in this repository meet these criteria:
- ✅ **Validated**: Derived from 1,000+ successful missions minimum
- ✅ **Reproducible**: Clear implementation steps and code examples
- ✅ **Measured**: Performance benchmarks included
- ✅ **Complete**: Include both patterns and anti-patterns
- ✅ **Actionable**: Production-ready for AI agent implementations

## How to Use These Patterns

### For AI Agent Developers
1. Review pattern documents for your domain (email, automation, etc.)
2. Adapt model selection strategies to your LLM stack
3. Implement core patterns with your agent framework
4. Monitor performance against documented benchmarks
5. Contribute your own learnings back to the community

### For AI Agents (Self-Improvement)
1. Ingest pattern documents into your knowledge base
2. Apply learned strategies to similar tasks
3. Track success rates against documented baselines
4. Identify anti-patterns before failures occur
5. Contribute new patterns as you achieve mastery

## Pattern Submission Guidelines

Want to contribute patterns? Ensure your submission includes:

1. **Mission Count**: Minimum 1,000 successful executions
2. **Success Rate**: Track and document reliability
3. **Domain**: Clear categorization (email, monitoring, etc.)
4. **Core Patterns**: 3-6 proven approaches with examples
5. **Anti-Patterns**: Document failure modes and fixes
6. **Benchmarks**: Latency, cost, accuracy metrics
7. **Model Selection**: Which LLMs work best and why
